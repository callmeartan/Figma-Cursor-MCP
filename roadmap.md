Phase 1: Planning and Research
Milestone: Define Project Scope and Requirements
Define Core Features:

AI-generated design systems, user flows, wireframes, and ideas.

Integration with Figma via API or plugins.

macOS app built with Flutter.

Context-aware interactions using MCP-like protocols.

Identify Tools and Technologies:

Figma API for design integration.

n8n for workflow automation.

Flutter for the macOS app.

AI Models (e.g., OpenAI GPT, DALL-E) for generating designs.

Research MCP Implementation:

Study the Model Context Protocol (MCP) or similar standards.

Plan how to implement context-aware interactions in your app.

Phase 2: Set Up Development Environment
Milestone: Prepare Tools and Infrastructure
Set Up n8n:

Install n8n locally or on a cloud server.

Explore n8n nodes for HTTP requests, AI integrations, and data transformation.

Set Up Flutter:

Install Flutter SDK and configure it for macOS development.

Set up a new Flutter project for your app.

Set Up Figma Integration:

Create a Figma account and generate an API token.

Explore Figma's REST API and plugin system.

Set Up AI Models:

Sign up for OpenAI API or other AI services.

Test AI models for generating design ideas, wireframes, and user flows.

Phase 3: Build Core Features
Milestone 1: Implement Figma Integration
Connect to Figma API:

Use Figma's REST API to fetch and update design files.

Implement endpoints for creating design systems, user flows, and wireframes.

Build a Figma Plugin (Optional):

Create a plugin to interact with your app and n8n workflows.

Use the plugin to automate tasks in Figma (e.g., applying styles, creating frames).

Milestone 2: Build AI Agent in n8n
Create Workflows for Design Generation:

Use AI models to generate design systems, user flows, and wireframes.

Map AI outputs to Figma's API for creating designs.

Implement Context-Aware Interactions:

Use n8n to capture and process context from user inputs, Figma, and AI models.

Build workflows that adapt based on context (e.g., user preferences, design trends).

Milestone 3: Build Flutter App
Design App UI:

Create a clean and intuitive interface for user prompts and design previews.

Use Flutter widgets to build the app layout.

Integrate with n8n:

Use HTTP requests or WebSockets to send user prompts to n8n.

Display AI-generated designs and Figma outputs in the app.

Implement MCP-Like Functionality:

Build custom logic for context-aware interactions.

Use APIs or WebSockets to sync data between the app, n8n, and Figma.

Phase 4: Test and Refine
Milestone: Ensure Stability and Usability
Test Figma Integration:

Verify that designs are created and updated correctly in Figma.

Test edge cases (e.g., large files, API rate limits).

Test AI Agent:

Validate AI-generated outputs for accuracy and relevance.

Refine prompts and workflows to improve results.

Test Flutter App:

Ensure the app works seamlessly on macOS.

Test user interactions, API calls, and error handling.

Gather Feedback:

Share the app with beta testers (e.g., designers, developers).

Collect feedback and iterate on the design and functionality.

Phase 5: Launch and Scale
Milestone: Release the App and Expand Features
Launch the App:

Publish the macOS app on the App Store or as a downloadable file.

Provide documentation and tutorials for users.

Monitor Performance:

Track app usage, API performance, and user feedback.

Optimize workflows and AI models based on usage patterns.

Add Advanced Features:

Real-Time Collaboration: Allow multiple users to collaborate on designs.

Analytics Dashboard: Provide insights into design trends and user behavior.

Custom AI Models: Fine-tune AI models for specific design tasks.

Expand Platforms:

Adapt the app for Windows and Linux using Flutter.

Explore mobile versions (iOS, Android) for on-the-go design.

Phase 6: Maintain and Improve
Milestone: Ensure Long-Term Success
Regular Updates:

Fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features.

Stay updated with Figma API changes and AI advancements.

Community Engagement:

Build a community of users and contributors.

Share tips, templates, and best practices.

Monetization (Optional):

Offer a free tier with basic features and a paid tier for advanced functionality.

Provide premium templates, AI models, or support.
